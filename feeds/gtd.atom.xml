read then and there. Bookmarks to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I end up with a
mountain of bookmarks. After years of experimenting, I've finally come up with
an effective system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmark things in chrome (or your browser of choice) as you find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly once a month, make a few folders to try and do some basic grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About once every 6 weeks, remember that you'd seen an interesting link on a
specific topic, but you can't seem to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about three months, realize you've now bookmarked more content than you
could read in a month. Declare bankruptcy, delete all links you can't read in
that sitting, and start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;future work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a later post, I plan to apply this same technique to handling email.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
