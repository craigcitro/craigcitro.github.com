      <description>I recently stumbled upon a link to Lockhart&#39;s Lament.
You should stop and read this right away, if you haven&#39;t already. It&#39;s a fairly harsh and biting attack on the state of math education (and more specifically K-12 math education) in the US. His main point is that the focus of the K-12 math curriculum has essentially nothing to do with the actual practice of mathematics, which is true. It&#39;s not perfect, but there&#39;s almost nothing I actually disagree with in it &amp;ndash; its only real sins are sins of omission.</description>
