      <description>It&#39;s been forever since I lived in LA, but I still long for some of the food. One of my friends asked for some food recs, so I&#39;m recording them here:
Amazing eats   Amandine: go and get the french toast, and then get anything else that sounds good. It&#39;s my absolute favorite french toast in the known universe, which is a strong compliment. Every pastry I had was good; I remember the coffee being good, but that was before I lived in Seattle, so that&#39;s harder to say.</description>

      <description>Cambridge, MA has one of the best concentrations of great eateries of any place I&#39;ve ever lived; here&#39;s the list of my favorites, dated from the last time I sent it along to someone. (I know at least Herrell&#39;s is gone, which is a crime against humanity.)
  Darwin&#39;s: my favorite place in Cambridge. There are two of them in Cambridge, one on Mt. Auburn, one on Cambridge St. The one on Cambridge St.</description>
